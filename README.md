# Travel Tracker
Travel Tracker is a frontend application that allows users to login and view their past and upcoming (pending/approved) trips. The user can also submit a trip of their choice, and that trip will populate on their dashboard as pending until an agent approves or denies it.

Travel Tracker was the final solo project built during Mod 2 of [Turing School of Software & Design](https://turing.edu/). The main objective was to use Object Oriented Programming to drive the design of the application and the code, work with an API to send and receive data, and utilize Test Driven Development.

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript
- CSS
- HTML
- Webpack
- Mocha & Chai
- Atom


## Future Additions
- Create a "profile" dropdown from the navigation bar
- Create a login page for travel agents to deny or approve trips
- Enhance styling of the user dashboard

## Wins
- Time management: I utilized a GitHub project board and filed issues for problems that arose. This allowed for a smooth workflow and a visual trail of my progress.
- Styling/CSS: I love finding new ways to style websites. I discovered how to create a help button on the login page with CSS.
- Creating my first login page: This was a new concept to me, and I'm proud to say I got it working with user credentials in mind.


## Challenges
- Call stack: It was a bit arduous tracking when certain bits were firing. Often times, I would add a piece of code and have to backtrack because it interrupted my original call stack. However, this process did help my visual understanding of the callstack a bit more because I got to see it in action.
- Webpack configuration for CSS: Webpack was originally configured for SCSS, so I had to research how to configure strictly for CSS. This set me back a couple hours on the first day and interrupted my workflow. However, it was a great learning experience and I feel better prepared for the next time.
